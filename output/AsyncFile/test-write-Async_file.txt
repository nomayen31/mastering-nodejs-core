This file was created as part of a demonstration on synchronous file writing in Node.js.

Node.js is a high-performance, event-driven, and non-blocking JavaScript runtime built on the V8 engine. 
It enables developers to build fast, scalable, and efficient server-side applications using JavaScript. 

This example showcases how to write text content to a file using the fs.writeFileSync() method.
